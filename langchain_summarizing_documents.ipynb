              "  Document(page_content='1.1 Defining Mark eting\\nLearning Objectiv e\\n1.Define marketing and outline its components.\\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as “the activity , set of institutions, and processes\\nfor creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging of ferings that have value for customers, clients, partners,\\nand society at lar ge1.” If you read the definition closely , you see that there are four activities, or components, of\\nmarketing:\\n1.Creating . The process of collaborating with suppliers and customers to create of ferings that have value.\\n2.Communicating . Broadly , describing those of ferings, as well as learning from customers.\\n3.Delivering . Getting those of ferings to the consumer in a way that optimizes value.\\n4.Exchanging . Trading value for those of ferings.\\nThe traditional way of viewing the components of marketing is via the four Ps:\\n1.Product . Goods and services (creating of ferings).\\n2.Promotion . Communication.\\n3.Place . Getting the product to a point at which the customer can purchase it (delivering).\\n4.Price. The monetary amount char ged for the product (exchanging).\\nIntroduced in the early 1950s, the four Ps were called the marketing mix, meaning that a marketing plan is a mix\\nof these four components.\\nIf the four Ps are the same as creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging, you might be wondering\\nwhy there was a change. The answer is that they are notexactly the same. Product, price, place, and promotion\\nare nouns. As such, these words fail to capture all the activities of marketing. For example, exchanging requires\\nmechanisms for a transaction, which consist of more than simply a price or place. Exchanging requires, among\\nother things, the transfer of ownership. For example, when you buy a car , you sign documents that transfer the\\ncar’s title from the seller to you. That’ s part of the exchange process.\\nEven the term product , which seems pretty obvious, is limited. Does the product include services that come with\\nyour new car purchase (such as free maintenance for a certain period of time on some models)? Or does the\\nproduct mean only the car itself?\\nFinally , none of the four Ps describes particularly well what marketing people do. However , one of the goals of\\nthis book is to focus on exactly what it is that marketing professionals do.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'principles_of_marketing_book.pdf', 'page': 10})],\n",
