        "Let’s say you’re making spaghetti marinara for dinner. Sauce from a jar is perfectly fine. But what if you buy your tomatoes and basil from the farmers market to make your own sauce? Chances are it will taste a lot better. And what if you grow your own ingredients in your garden and make your own fresh pasta? A whole new level of savory deliciousness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as better ingredients can make for a better dinner, better inputs into a generative AI (gen AI) model can make for better results. These inputs are called prompts, and the practice of writing them is called prompt engineering. Skilled prompt engineers design inputs that interact optimally with other inputs in a gen AI tool. These inputs help elicit better answers from the AI model, meaning the model can perform its tasks better, such as writing marketing emails, generating code, analyzing and synthesizing text, engaging with customers via chatbots, creating digital art, composing music, or any of the other hundreds, if not thousands, of current applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is generative AI?\n",
        "\n",
        "First things first: a refresher on gen AI. Gen AI models are applications typically built using foundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks, inspired by the billions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what’s called deep learning, which refers to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many recent advances in AI—things you’re probably already using, like Alexa or Siri—but foundation models represent a significant evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep-learning models, foundation models can process massive and varied sets of unstructured data. AI that is trained on these models can perform tasks such as answering questions and classifying, editing, summarizing, and drafting new content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of the value of specificity in prompt engineering. We asked Lilli, McKinsey’s proprietary gen AI tool, to help summarize a report. We gave the tool two prompts, with specific requests for different kinds of information. Take a look at the different outputs Lilli provided.\n",
        "How are organizations deploying gen AI?\n",
        "\n",
        "Developing a gen AI model from scratch is so resource intensive that it’s out of the question for most companies. Organizations looking to incorporate gen AI tools into their business models can either use off-the-shelf gen AI models or customize an existing model by training it with their own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other organizations, including McKinsey, have launched their own gen AI tools. Morgan Stanley has launched a gen AI tool to help its financial advisers better apply insights from the company’s 100,000-plus research reports. The government of Iceland has partnered with OpenAI to work on preserving the Icelandic language. And enterprise software company Salesforce has integrated gen AI technology into its popular customer relationship management (CRM) platform. McKinsey’s Lilli provides streamlined, impartial search and synthesis of vast stores of knowledge to bring the best insights, capabilities, and technology solutions to clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "How will gen AI affect the workforce?\n",
        "\n",
        "McKinsey’s latest research suggests that gen AI is poised to boost performance across sales and marketing, customer operations, software development, and more. In the process, gen AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, across sectors from banking to life sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The breakthroughs powered by gen AI will also change the workforce. One of gen AI’s strengths is that it can help nearly everyone with their jobs. This is also one of the technology’s greatest challenges. McKinsey estimates that gen AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb up to 70 percent of employees’ time today. This is largely due to gen AI’s ability to predict the patterns found in natural language. This, in turn, means that gen AI stands to have more impact on knowledge work associated with occupations that have higher wages and more educational requirements. And this change will likely happen fast: McKinsey estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060. That’s roughly a decade earlier than our previous estimates.\n",

        "As the world progresses, the types of engineers required continue to evolve. The earliest known occurrence of an engineer comes back from ancient times, with military engineers being responsible for designing and building fortifications, siege engines and other military structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast forward thousands of years, and you start to see civil engineers being introduced. We then move into the digital age, and software engineers cement their spot in the world of engineering. Now, with AI taking the world by storm, the next type of engineering skill that is becoming high in demand is prompt engineering.\n",
        "What Prompt Engineering Is\n",
        "Prompt engineering is the practice and process of crafting strategic questions to ultimately reach your desired output when leveraging a language model or other machine learning systems. If we look at prompt engineering when it comes to ChatGPT, a reference many of us are now familiar with, prompt engineering involves the effort of typing questions into the chat bar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The skill of prompt engineering may seem trivial, but it truly is a skill. An effective prompt engineer understands the language model's capabilities, limitations and tendencies, tailoring the input prompt to guide the model toward generating the desired content. A good prompt engineer is someone who can retrieve their desired outcome with their first effort.\n",
        "The skillset needed by a prompt engineer will differ depending on what you're looking to receive from your AI application. If you're looking for the answer to \"What is 2+2,\" well, that is an easy prompt with a very straightforward answer and, therefore, doesn't require much engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, imagine you need your AI model to spit out code that allows you to perform certain actions while avoiding specific errors. To receive your desired output, you need to ask the question in a certain way so that the language model will not only be able to understand but will be able to return the exact outcome you are looking for.\n",
        "Applications Of Prompt Engineers\n",
        "There are many reasons you'd want a prompt engineer—someone focused on the most efficient outcome when it comes to leveraging AI models. Some applications can include controlling creativity, fine-tuning responses, mitigating bias and enhancing accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Controlling Creativity: Adjusting prompts allows users to control the level of creativity or specificity in the generated content. As the prompt engineer, you can determine how detailed you want the reply to be. The deeper your instructions are, the more creatively you can influence a unique output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fine-Tuning Responses: By tweaking the words or sentence structure of a prompt, you can influence the model to provide more contextually accurate responses. For example, if you're writing a paper on the history of the invention of the wheel, you probably will want to know the founding of the wheel across different civilizations. This requires you to engineer your question to ensure the AI model knows you're looking for multiple answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Mitigating Bias: Prompt engineering can be used to reduce biases in model outputs by leading the questions to return a more objective reply based solely on facts. You can encourage models to ignore certain voices or look specifically for objective references.\n",
        "4. Enhancing Accuracy: Crafting specific and targeted prompts will help you generate more accurate outputs. The more specific and tailored your question, the more value you'll get out of the effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "All in all, while the future doesn't have a definitive roadmap, what we can discern from the information available to us is that in today's world, prompt engineering is a valuable skill to harness. While technology may make this role less impactful as time goes on, it currently retains value and can help position you as a stronger employee or job candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Put simply, this is the science of asking really good questions. So even if the role of prompt engineering diminishes, the skillset of knowing how to ask good and targeted questions is an attractive trait to embrace.\n",

        "January 26, 2024\n",
        "It seems like everyone knows, or wants to know, how to produce the best possible prompts for generative AI. Having the right prompts can, in theory, allow managers to gather important information in a matter of seconds. But, among the buzz and promise of masterful prompt engineering, there is an emerging risk that managers will view generative AI as a one-stop-shop for gathering information. In doing so, they may neglect their most valuable information resources: employees, partners, and customers. These stakeholders offer contextual information and tacit knowledge that is beyond the capability of any generative AI tool. As we get better at speaking to robots, we should remember how to most effectively speak to our colleagues and customers, too.\n",
        "\n",
        "A trailblazer for harnessing insights from stakeholders was the former CEO of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. To forge a closer relationship with stakeholders Iwata personally conducted an extensive series of interviews over a 9-year period with employees, industry experts, and developers who had been involved in the creation of Nintendo games and hardware.\n",
        "The goal of the interviews was to gather their insights and use them to his advantage in steering the organization and driving it forward. For example, as part of a series of interviews conducted about Nintendo Wii hardware, Iwata discovered that during the development process some engineers had conflicting opinions regarding the organization’s decision not to go with sheer power in the console to match industry rivals Sony (PlayStation 3) and Microsoft (Xbox 360). Iwata used this information to understand engineers’ anxieties and to find ways to resolve their issues. He explained that prompting key stakeholders was a chance to listen to the thoughts and opinions of others, from which he was able to gain new perspectives and insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "We should frequently study and refine how we prompt customers, employees, and partners. In this article, I draw on my experience of studying more than 40 organizations and how they engage with different stakeholders to harness information. My research has involved working closely with organizations and managers by observing what they do, and my consultancy projects have provided managers with guidance on how best to engage with stakeholders. I use this experience to offer practical advice for you to initiate discussions with stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Structure your prompts the right way.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s important to frame prompts to ensure optimum responses. There are a few ways that you can do this. One way is by choosing to use open-ended prompts. These are essential for inviting detailed and expansive responses from stakeholders. For example, we know that open-ended questions typically begin with phrases like “Can you tell me about…” or “How did you go about…” and stakeholder prompts can follow a similar structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, using comparative prompts to explore differences and similarities as conversations progress can also provide deeper insights. They are also a good way to draw out opinions. You might ask, “When you look back at [project A] and compare it to [project B], what were some of the distinctive challenges you encountered?” or “Were there lessons learned from the development of [previous product] that influenced how you approached the challenges in [current product]?” However, prompts need not only explore the past. Prompts with a future-orientation, such as those concerning plans and aspirations, encourages stakeholders to discuss their visions, hopes, and expectations. This not only sheds light on upcoming developments but also prompts stakeholders to think ahead, both critically and strategically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Utilize reflective and thoughtful probing.\n",
        "\n",
        "By being reflective and thoughtful with prompts, you can ensure you give the impression that you have considered the intricacies of the conversation and topic at hand. For instance, sometimes stakeholders need to explain detailed technical information and it is important that you can show your own understanding of certain business processes (e.g., hardware design) or that you seek to better understand it.\n",
        "\n",
        "A prompt may ask, for example: “I understand the technical requirements of [product A] consist of [….], how do they differ for [product B]?” or “What were the advancements in technology that significantly impacted the development process?” This can encourage stakeholders to share technical insights confidently.\n",
        "Ultimately, probing prompts encourage stakeholders to provide more considered and detailed responses. Storytelling or sharing experiences related to specific business processes can also be advantageous. This not only makes the conversation more engaging, but it also encourages stakeholders to share their own stories and experiences with you.\n",
        "3. Convey empathetic language and humility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompts should try to contain empathetic language so that connections with stakeholders can be conveyed on a personal level. This approach can also make stakeholders feel more comfortable about sharing experiences and opinions and foster an open and honest dialogue. A prompt such as, “I can see very clearly how difficult that situation must have been,” can show that you understand and are thinking about how stakeholders are feeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further, acknowledging and appreciating stakeholders can build positive reinforcement. In turn, this encourages stakeholders to share more and provides a positive atmosphere for discussion. Embodying humility, such as being frank and honest when you don’t understand something a stakeholder is saying, complements this positive atmosphere. Using prompts like, “Can you explain that to me again so I’m sure that I understand?” shows stakeholders that their time, and their knowledge, is not taken for granted.\n",
        "4. Harness humor, playfulness, and emotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "When appropriate, injecting humor and playfulness into stakeholder prompts will help to create a relaxed atmosphere, making stakeholders more likely to share candid and genuine opinions. An example might be by making light of a situation, sharing a funny story, or even by offering some gentle and humorous self-deprecation like “I’m hopeless at doing that!” Sometimes situations require comedic relief.\n",
        "\n",
        "Asking about past experiences that evoke emotions such as nostalgia, excitement, a sense of accomplishment, or even fear, can provoke deeper and more valuable reflection. For example, you might find that expressing your own excitement and passion for something like “This is absolutely fascinating and I’m learning a lot,” can ignite similar emotions from stakeholders, generating anticipation, a sense of shared enthusiasm, or candor about lessons learned.\n",
        "5. Acknowledge key challenges.\n",
        "\n",

Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning ability by inducing the model to answer a multi-step problem with steps of reasoning that mimic a train of thought.[28][17][29] It allows large language models to overcome difficulties with some reasoning tasks that require logical thinking and multiple steps to solve, such as arithmetic or commonsense reasoning questions.[30][31][32]\n",
        "For example, given the question \"Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?\", a CoT prompt might induce the LLM to answer \"A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9.\"[17]\n",
        "As originally proposed,[17] each CoT prompt included a few Q&A examples. This made it a few-shot prompting technique. However, simply appending the words \"Let's think step-by-step\",[33] has also proven effective, which makes CoT a zero-shot prompting technique. This allows for better scaling as a user no longer needs to formulate many specific CoT Q&A examples.[34]\n",
        "When applied to PaLM, a 540B parameter language model, CoT prompting significantly aided the model, allowing it to perform comparably with task-specific fine-tuned models on several tasks, achieving state of the art results at the time on the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark.[17] It is possible to fine-tune models on CoT reasoning datasets to enhance this capability further and stimulate better interpretability.[35][36]\n",

This stands in contrast to the intended operation of instruction-following systems, wherein the ML model is intended only to follow trusted instructions (prompts) provided by the ML model's operator.[69][70][71]\n",

        "Common types of prompt injection attacks are:\n",
        "jailbreaking, which may include asking the model to roleplay a character, to answer with arguments, or to pretend to be superior to moderation instructions[75]\n",

        "token smuggling, is another type of jailbreaking attack, in which the nefarious prompt is wrapped in a code writing task.[77]\n",
        "Prompt injection can be viewed as a code injection attack using adversarial prompt engineering. In 2022, the NCC Group characterized prompt injection as a new class of vulnerability of AI/ML systems.[78]\n",
        "In early 2023, prompt injection was seen \"in the wild\" in minor exploits against ChatGPT, Bard, and similar chatbots, for example to reveal the hidden initial prompts of the systems,[79] or to trick the chatbot into participating in conversations that violate the chatbot's content policy.[80] One of these prompts was known as \"Do Anything Now\" (DAN) by its practitioners.[81]\n",
        "For LLM that can query online resources, such as websites, they can be targeted for prompt injection by placing the prompt on a website, then prompt the LLM to visit the website.[82][83] Another security issue is in LLM generated code, which may import packages not previously existing. An attacker can first prompt the LLM with commonly used programming prompts, collect all packages imported by the generated programs, then find the ones not existing on the official registry. Then the attacker can create such packages with malicious payload and upload them to the official registry.[84]\n",
        "Mitigation[edit]\n",
        "Since the emergence of prompt injection attacks, a variety of mitigating countermeasures have been used to reduce the susceptibility of newer systems. These include input filtering, output filtering, Reinforcement learning from human feedback, and prompt engineering to separate user input from instructions.[85][86]\n",
        "In October 2019, Junade Ali and Malgorzata Pikies of Cloudflare submitted a paper which showed that when a front-line good/bad classifier (using a neural network) was placed before a Natural Language Processing system, it would disproportionately reduce the number of false positive classifications at the cost of a reduction in some true positives.[87][88] In 2023, this technique was adopted an open-source project Rebuff.ai to protect prompt injection attacks, with Arthur.ai announcing a commercial product - although such approaches do not mitigate the problem completely.[89][90][91]\n",
        "As of August 2023, leading Large Language Model developers were still unaware of how to stop such attacks.[92] In September 2023, Junade Ali shared that he and Frances Liu had successfully been able to mitigate prompt injection attacks (including on attack vectors the models had not been exposed to before) through giving Large Language Models the ability to engage in metacognition (similar to having an inner monologue) and that they held a provisional United States patent for the technology - however, they decided to not enforce their intellectual property rights and not pursue this as a business venture as market conditions were not yet right (citing reasons including high GPU costs and a currently limited number of safety-critical use-cases for LLMs).[93][94]\n",
